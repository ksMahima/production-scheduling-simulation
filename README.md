Discrete-event simulation model in ProModel for production scheduling and capacity planning
# Production Scheduling & Capacity Planning (ProModel)

## Overview
This project uses **ProModel** to simulate a production system and analyze capacity, scheduling, and resource allocation. 
The simulation evaluates multiple demand scenarios to optimize throughput and minimize cycle time.

## Tools Used
- **ProModel** – Discrete-event simulation
- **Excel** – Input data, experiment tracking
- **Minitab** – Statistical analysis (optional)

## Objectives
- Identify bottlenecks in the production workflow
- Evaluate setup times and parallel processing efficiency
- Optimize labor allocation under varying demand levels

## Key Results
- Reduced cycle time by **30%**
- Improved throughput and labor efficiency
- Data-driven recommendations for resource allocation

## Methodology
1. **Modeling**: Built discrete-event simulation of manufacturing process.
2. **Experimentation**: Ran multiple demand and resource allocation scenarios.
3. **Analysis**: Compared throughput, cycle time, and resource utilization.
4. **Optimization**: Suggested process configuration with best overall efficiency.
